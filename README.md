  2. On the top right of the page, there's a button with the option Fork. Click on it.
  3. A new page, "Create a new fork", will open. If you wish, you can edit the name.
  4. At the end of the page, click on "Create fork".

### **How to Clone**

  1. Log In or Sign Up to GitHub.
  2. Go to this project repository [https://github.com/ksumm/the_Bloom_PP5](https://github.com/ksumm/the_Bloom_PP5)
  3. Click on the Code button and select if you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link.
